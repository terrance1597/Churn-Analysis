# Churn-Analysis
The given data was cleaned and processed by encoding the categorical variables and normalizing the features. A binary
classifier was implemented using an Artificial Neural Network with Keras. The classification rate was improved by
using Cross Validation approach and by tuning the hyper-parameters using GridSearchCV.
